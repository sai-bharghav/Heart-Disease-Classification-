# Heart Disease Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`End-to-End heart disease classification.ipynb`) that demonstrates an end-to-end heart disease classification project. The notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Overview

Heart disease is a prevalent and serious health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and classification of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators. These attributes are used to train and evaluate the machine learning model. This dataset has been taken from kaggle and you can check the link from the notebook.

## Methods and Techniques

The notebook employs popular machine learning techniques for classification, including:

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model selection: Exploring different classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- Model evaluation: Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- Model deployment: Demonstrating how to deploy the trained model using a Flask web application for real-world use.
